# CDP-LLDP-with-arduino
This repository is for the CDP project originally started here: http://www.modlog.net/?p=907 and then revisited and LLDP added here: http://www.modlog.net/?p=1591

The original code was by Chris van Marle - CDPSniffino: https://github.com/qistoph/CdpSniffino. It was butchered to suit the ENC28J60 chipset with a red PCB ST7735 LCD.

Xmutantson: I have further forked this fork, to "work" with a 1602A LCD. It works for CDP but LLDP is still a work in progress. Also my code is sloppy but functional. I tried to add additional comments. Some of them may be mine, some of them may be from the original sources.
